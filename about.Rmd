Hello and welcome to my DDS website!

Some quick information about me:

  I am originally from Tampa, FL but moved to Texas when I was about seven years old. 
  
  I enjoy spending time with family and playing with my one year old goldendoodle named Oliver.
  
  I currently work for Conifer Health Solutions as a Business Insight Analyst II. 
  
  I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2020 with a degree focusing on Criminology.
